# Weather

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## My Project

In this project I used a weather API to get the weather based on the location the user types in.

## Installation

In the command line interface, you can do the following:

### `npm install`
This installs the project dependencies.

### `npm install --save react-bootstrap bootstrap`
This installs the bootstrap needed for styling.

## Usage
To start the application type the following in the command line interface:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
